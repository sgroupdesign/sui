# Overview
Our JS framework consists of a collection of Vue components as well as vanilla JS components. Where possible, we encourage the use of vanilla JS across the board.

We also heavily rely on [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) for unstyled Vue components. These are highly accessible and make no assumptions on how they look, and are excellent. In much the same way we use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for CSS, always refer to Headless UI for functionality first before building your own.
