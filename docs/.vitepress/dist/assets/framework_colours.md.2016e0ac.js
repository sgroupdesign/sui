Instead, you should use our additional brand-related classes below. Only override the default Tailwind classes if you know what you&#39;re doing. There&#39;s been considerable work from the Tailwind team to ensure these colours <a href="https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2#all-new-color-palette" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look right</a>.</p><p>We provide <code>primary</code> and <code>secondary</code> colour classes, typically used for brand colours. You can also add your own colours to the <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file. They should always follow a 50-900 scale (lightest to darkest) with 500 being the &quot;true&quot; colour.
