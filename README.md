# SUI Vue
A collection of headless Vue components, for web development.

## What does headless mean?
With headless components you'll have (almost) full control over markup and styling. We don’t want to tell you what a menu should look like or where it should be rendered in the DOM. That’s all up to you. There is also a [great article about headless components by Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/).

## Plan
We'll create separate packages for each component, so you can include them in your projects as required.

Each component package should be versioned independantly, with a changelog maintained for each, according to [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
